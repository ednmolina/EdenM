### Internships
- [NASA JPL Internship]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-06-20-JPL-Internship %})

  * I interned at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the Summer of 2016 exploring the correlation between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the underlying dark matter distribution. I used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate weak gravitational signals because dark matter is known to interact only through the gravitational force.

  <!-- This was made possible by UC Riverside's Fellowship and Internships in Extremely Large Data Sets (FIELDS). -->


- [Fulcrum Labs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-10-FulcrumLabs %})
  * At Fulcrum Labs I worked on natural language processing algorithms to determine how similar a student's short answer response is to a body of text. I am currently working on creating a prediction model that will forecast how long it will take a student to complete a course. This is important because of Fulcrum's platform is adaptive. The questions a student answers for every course is tailored for each student depending how well the answer the questions.


### Research
- [UCLA Doubly Lensed Quasars]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-22-UCLA-Quasar %})
  * At UCLA I worked with doubly lensed quasar images from the Keck Observatory, the world's largest optical telescope. I am currently modeling the quasars by reconstructing the images using `lenstronomy`. I have presented my work at UCLA's undergraduate research week.

- [UCLA Search for Extraterrestial Life (SETI)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-01-UCLA-SETI %})
  * I, along with about 15 other students, chose G-type stars to collect radio signals using the Green Bank Telescope, the world's largest radio telescope, searching for extraterrestrial life. I worked on a team to add a plotting scheme to the data processing pipeline that will cluster and plot statistical information about candidate extraterrestrial signals.

### Part-Time
- [UCLA Meteorite Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-25-UCLA-Meteorite-Lab %})
  * I worked at UCLA's meteorite lab, the second largest in any university, for about a year and a half as a lab assistant. I prepared meteorite samples for neutron activation analysis (NAA) by cutting them to specific sizes and ensuring there are no contaminates on the samples which would compromise the accuracy of the measurements  we collect after they have been irradiated. I also worked on plotting the spectra of each of the samples so that we can determine the constituent elements of the meteorites and properly classify the meteorite samples.

### Volunteering
- [UCLA Astronomical Soceity]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-01-UCLA-UAS %})
  * I was a telescope operator and social media director at UCLA's Astronomical Society. I posted to the club's social media about telescope shows we ran every Wednesday night which I co-hosted with my fellow club officers. We showed various celestial objects which include, but are not limited to: the Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Orion nebula.

### Scholarship Programs
- [JPL JPLUS Scholarship]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-06-20-JPL-JPLUS %})
  * I was awarded this JPL scholarship my freshman year in undergrad. I spent 6 months at JPL (June 2015 to December 2015) attending lectures, talks, and networking events pertaining to research at Cal Tech and JPL.
