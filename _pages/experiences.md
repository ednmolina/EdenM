### Internships
- [NASA JPL Internship]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-06-20-JPL-Internship %})

  * I interned at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the Summer of 2016 exploring the correlation between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the underlying dark matter distribution. I used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate weak gravitational signals because dark matter is known to interact only through the gravitational force.

  <!-- This was made possible by UC Riverside's Fellowship and Internships in Extremely Large Data Sets (FIELDS). -->


- [Fulcrum Labs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-10-FulcrumLabs %})
* At Fulcrum Labs I worked on natural language processing algorithms to determine how similar a student's short answer response is to a body of text. I created a deep learning model to predict the amount of time a student will take to complete a course--this was important as Fulcrum is an adapting learning platform, meaning every students learning path is unique. The questions a student answers for every course is tailored for each student depending how well the answer the questions. I have also writted automated reporting scripts in R, as well as an R package to standardize the aesthetics of charts.


### Research
- [UCLA Doubly Lensed Quasars]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-22-UCLA-Quasar %})
* At UCLA I worked with doubly lensed quasar images from the Keck Observatory, the world's largest optical telescope. I modeled the quasars by reconstructing the images using `lenstronomy`. I have presented my work at UCLA's undergraduate research week. Some scripts I write for this project can be seen in [this repo](https://github.com/ednmolina/UCLA-Quasar-Project). The findings of the research have been submitted the Royal Astronmical Society as of March 2020.

- [UCLA Search for Extraterrestial Life (SETI)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-01-UCLA-SETI %})
  * I, along with about 15 other students, chose G-type stars to collect radio signals using the Green Bank Telescope, the world's largest radio telescope, searching for extraterrestrial life. I worked on a team to add a plotting scheme to the data processing pipeline that will cluster and plot statistical information about candidate extraterrestrial signals.

### Part-Time
- [UCLA Meteorite Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-25-UCLA-Meteorite-Lab %})
  * I worked at UCLA's meteorite lab, the second largest in any university, for about a year and a half as a lab assistant. I prepared meteorite samples for neutron activation analysis (NAA) by cutting them to specific sizes and ensuring there are no contaminates on the samples which would compromise the accuracy of the measurements  we collect after they have been irradiated. I also worked on plotting the spectra of each of the samples so that we can determine the constituent elements of the meteorites and properly classify the meteorite samples.

### Volunteering
- [UCLA Astronomical Soceity]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-01-UCLA-UAS %})
  * I was a telescope operator and social media director at UCLA's Astronomical Society. I posted to the club's social media about telescope shows we ran every Wednesday night which I co-hosted with my fellow club officers. We showed various celestial objects which include, but are not limited to: the Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Orion nebula.


### Courses
- [Acoustics Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-01-Physics180D %})
  * In this course I investigated acoustics and vibrations in various mediums. We investigated the normal modes of rectangular and cylindrical rooms, the dispersive nature of waves in shallow water, characterized the luminescence of gas in water driven by an acoustic field, investigated the properties of liquid helium.

- [Electronics Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-03-Physics117 %})
  * This was a hands-on experimental course that have my a first hand experience in understanding the design principles of modern electronics for physics measurements. At the end of the course we made a game out of the electronics we studied throughout the quarter apply our knowledge on analog and digital electronics, and logic gates.

### Scholarship Programs
- [JPL JPLUS Scholarship]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-06-20-JPL-JPLUS %})
  * I was awarded this JPL scholarship my freshman year in undergrad. I spent 6 months at JPL (June 2015 to December 2015) attending lectures, talks, and networking events pertaining to research at Cal Tech and JPL.
