### Research
I have done research in dark matter, gravitationally lensed quasars, extraterrestrial life, and meteorites.

### Career Goals
I am interested in a career in the relm of data science--harnesing the vast amount of data avilable today to solve complex problems and inform decision making in a business. I have experience in natural language processing, but I am also looking for opportunities regarding computer vision. 

### Hobbies
I am interested in photography, building skyscraper models out of paper, and food. I am currently working with a friend on launching a food blog which will gather data on various restaurants from our travels and try to extract correlations from the data about restaurants. On the weekends you can probably find me in a cafe somewhere in LA.
