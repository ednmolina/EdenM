This is the about page! This is where I'll put skills and relevant experience.

# Education
I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with a B.S. in Physics.

# Research
During undergrad I have done research regarding the distribution of dark matter in galaxies and galaxy clusters, and the automation in the classification of lensed quasars from images.

# Hobbies
On my free time I enjoy taking photos of architecture, nature, and everyday life with my Nikon DSLR. I enjoy photography and am looking into computational photography.
