### Research
I have done research in dark matter, gravitationally lensed quasars, extraterrestrial life, and meteorites. My current interests are in image processing and artificial intelligence. I hope to enroll in a graduate program in statistics to learn how to devise statistical models.

### Career Goals
I hope to find employment in a company that enables research using statistical modeling and artificial intelligence. Having a technical background in physics, data processing is my bread and butter and implementing I hope to make use of my skills in realms outside of physics.

### Hobbies
I am interested in photography, building skyscraper models out of paper, and food. I am currently working with a friend on launching a food blog which will gather data on various restaurants from our travels and try to extract correlations from the data about restaurants. On the weekends you can probably find me in a cafe somewhere in LA.
