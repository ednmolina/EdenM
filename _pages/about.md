## Education
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2018 with a B.S. in Physics.

## Research
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During undergrad I have done research regarding the distribution of dark matter in galaxies and galaxy clusters, and the automation in the classification of lensed quasars from images.

## Career Goals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a physicist by training, I have had extensive experience processing data. I hope to apply my technical skills into the real world as a data scientist creating models to tackle real world problems.

## Hobbies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my free time I enjoy taking photos of architecture, nature, and everyday life with my Nikon DSLR. I enjoy photography and am looking into computational photography. I also an avid foodie about to launch a food blog, and a coffee addict on the search for the best cafes.
