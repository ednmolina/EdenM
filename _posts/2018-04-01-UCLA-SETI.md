In this course approximately 30 students worked to improve the existing data analysis developed by previous classes. The goal of the pipeline is to classify radio signals from the Greenbank Telescope as technosignatures of extraterrestrial civilizations.

Almost every student in the course got to choose a particular star he/she wished to have observed by the Greenbank Telescope--the world's largest radio telescope. We collected terabytes of data and our pipeline found about 1 million candidate signals that were likely not produced by humans like GPS signals and radio signals from communications devices.

My group wrote a script that would plot various features of a signal against one another. The various signal features we analyze were frequency, drift rate, and signal to noise ratio. Furthermore, we also clustered our data using K-Means clustering to see if we could observe any similarities within clustered signals.

I'm the second person from the right of the top row!
