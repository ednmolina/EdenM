# May 2017 - October 2018
For the latter half of my undergraduate career at UCLA, I worked at the UCLA Metoerite Lab as a lab assistant. There I updated the data base of meteorite data that my boss, Professor John Wasson, has been collecting for over half a century.

Other responsibilities at the lab included preparing meteorite samples for neutron activation. Neutron activation is the process which makes the meteorites radioactive. This process allowed us to measure the spectra, or the composition of the meteorites. Preparing the samples for neutron activation involved slicing the meteorite at strategic locations to ensure the sample we cut won't have 'contaminants' which can range from silicate deposits or oxidation. One last responsibility I had while working at the lab was to photograph meteorites and museum labels for the meteorite gallery located on the third floor of the Geology Building at UCLA. My photographs and labels are still in the gallery today!

I highly recommend visiting it as the meteorite collection at UCLA is the fifth largest in the United States and the second largest housed at any university in the world!
