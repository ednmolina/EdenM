As a kid, I was fascinated with the skyscrapers that loomed over the world's metropolitan cities. I began papercrafting because I wanted to have a piece of these large cities. It wasn't realistic to travel to a new city every day just to see these things. So the next logical thing in my head was to invert the problem instead of bringing myself to the skyscrapers, why not bring the skyscrapers to me? And so I fell into this rabbit hole.

I began to build scale models from [SkyscraperModels](http://skyscrapermodels.us/Home.html) and the rabbit hold get even deeper when I found out about SkyscraperCity, an online forum for people interested about Skyscrapers.

Over the years, I have built models other than skyscrapers. Below is a model I found of NASA's Saturn V which was humanity's vehicle to The Moon.




I have also built models of more cultural architectual pieces such as the Notra Dame de Paris, Houryuuji Temple, and Wat Phra Kaew.
