# Overview of Research
Under Professor Tommaso Treu, his graduate students, and his post-docs we worked on a prject that cronicled five years of follow up and confirmation lensed quasars through Keck-NIRC2, a camera at Keck Observatory. I learned how to perform image analysis with Python and how to run Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to optimize parameters given a model attempting to describe observed data. I used an MCMC to estimate the amount of light, flux, of galaxies and quasars we objected in the images by assuming the distribution of light emitted by the objects followed a Gaussian Distribution.

A research [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r2oRGAJdwo8EXGQ4lBQLHF3bH76_fRS8/view?usp=sharing) I made presenting some of my work.

Furthermore, using [_lenstronomy_](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy), software developed by one of Professor Treu's post-doc's we reconstructed the images of quasars from our sample to improve our measurements of the magnitude of the lensing galaxies.
