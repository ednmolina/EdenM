At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) I worked under Jason Rhodes and Hironao Miyatake to investigate assembly bias as a function of brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) ellipticity.  The clustering of dark matter halos is enhanced by the underlying dark matter distribution that we do not see, this phenomena is called bias. It has been theoretically shown that bias can depend on other halo properties other than mass, this is known as assembly bias.

I used data 8,648 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) red-sequence DR8 Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation (redMaPPer) galaxy clusters. I write Python scripts to extract statistics from the catalog of galaxies and galaxy clusters. After calculating the weak lensing and clustering signals from the data it was found that there was not evidence of assembly bias correlated with BCG ellipticity.

More details about the project can be found in [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKP9kqtFVC72Ax0UybrYBXIOzsmCFdqK/view?usp=sharing) report I wrote summarizing what I did that summer.
