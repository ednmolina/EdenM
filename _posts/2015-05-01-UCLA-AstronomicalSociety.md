From 2017 - 2018 I was a telescope operator and social media officer at UCLA's Astronomical Society. Every clear Wednesday night, members of the UCLA Astronomical Society host a telescope show after the planetarium show at the roof of UCLA's Mathematical Sciences Building. We would show visitors, which included students or general visitor from around UCLA, celestial objects visible through LA's light pollution. Theses objects included, the Moon, the outer planets, and nebulae. It was a rewarding experience showing the public the cosmos and sharing our knowledge with them. I still occasionally drop by and see how the club is doing when I have time.
