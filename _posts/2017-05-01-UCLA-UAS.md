During the end of my junior as an undergrad, I joined UCLA's Astronomical Society as a telescope operator and social media director. During my first few months at the club I was able to make an old Dobsonian Telescope usable again by realigning and cleaning its mirrors. I also co-hosted the telescope shows at UCLA which we ran and still currently run every Wednesday night-if the weather permit. We show the public celestial objects visible through LA's light pollution. Often time we showed the Moon, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, and the Orion Nebula. Furthermore, as social media director I managed the Facebook posts and Instagram page of the club.
