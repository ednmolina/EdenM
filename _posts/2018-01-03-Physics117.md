excerpt: "This was a hands-on experimental course that have my a first hand experience in understanding the design principles of modern electronics for physics measurements. At the end of the course we made a game out of the electronics we studied throughout the quarter apply our knowledge on analog and digital electronics, and logic gates."

This course gave me a broad introduction to analog and digital principles in modern electronics. I learned how to produce signals using a function generator and acquire data about that signal using an oscilloscope. Furthermore, we applied techniques such as Fast Fourier Transform to perform signal processing.

My final project was to create a device that determines the reaction time of two players. Once turned on, the device would start a counter advancing every millisecond and will stop when another player pushes the button. For this project my partner and I first prototyped our circuit on a breadboard, then soldered on the parts onto a PCB. I made a [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1seslTp-v6la_9GSq0E2AyguvZLCzqBnE) showing how this product works.
