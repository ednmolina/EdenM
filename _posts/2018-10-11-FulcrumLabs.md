I am currently a Data Science intern for Fulcrum Labs, a start up developing an adaptive learning platform. During my first quarter at the company I devised a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm that will determine if a student's response to a question is related to a body of text they were to read.

Furthermore, I prototyped an algorithm that will assign a performance score to a student given a report from an instructor about a student's behavior in class. This performance score and be augmented by how well they complete courses on the platform.

I used Python with the help of standard libraries to implement my algorithms. Such libraries include, *numpy*, *pandas*, *scikit-learn*, *matplotlib*, *Tensorflow*, and *Keras*.
