I am currently a Data Science intern for Fulcrum Labs, a start up developing an adaptive learning platform. During my first quarter at the company I devised a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm that will determine if a student's response to a question is related to a body of text they were to read. Furthermore, I prototyped an algorithm that will assign a performance score to a student given a report from an instructor about a student's behavior in class. This performance score and be augmented by how well they complete courses on the platform.
